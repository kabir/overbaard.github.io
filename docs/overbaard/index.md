```
'Bård' is a Norwegian name pronounced 'board' (alternative spelling: 'baard').
```

Overbård is a lightning fast Kanban board integrating with Jira. It is shipped as a Jira add-on, and was written to
address some of Jira Software's short-comings when it comes to how it displays the boards. Effectively this means:
* horizontally scrollable boards, with collapsible columns.
* making setup of filters and swimlanes less static, minimising the need for configuration. Since we
are using a 'fat' browser client, all changes to the view purely happen on the client side with no need
for extra round trips to the server.

Apart from the configuration, all the data and permissions are driven by your Jira instance.

Read the guides to see more of our innovative features such as:
* setting up custom fields to filter and create swimlanes for
* parallel tasks
* displaying linked issues from other projects
* the ability to configure independent workflows based on issue type
* displaying issues from several issues on one board
 
## Guides

These guides are listed in order of 'complexity'. We also have a read-only demo 
[instance](https://overbaard.github.io/demo) that you can play with to get a feel for the UI 
without needing to install it to your Jira instance.

* [User Guide](user-guide.md) - for end users of Overbård.
* [Admin Guide](admin-guide.md) - for administrators to configure new boards.
* [Developer Guide](developer-guide.md) - how to set up the environment for contributors to the project.
